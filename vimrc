" A brief manifesto
" ===================
" Another day, another new text editor (except this one happens to be the one
" I've used for a decade+). But why? Isn't VSCode good enough for you? What
" about emacs/evil—you were all about that for a minute, right? Yes, me, I
" was. First, re: VSCode, it's great, and I do enjoy using it. It's incredibly
" helpful writing web code. BUT it's a lot. I don't generally care for
" electron apps (please do not @ me), I don't especially want to be surveilled
" by $MSFT while working, and generally I'm trying to cut out tools from the
" big tech companies—even the open source ones (again, please do not @ me, and
" no I haven't decided yet whether this means I ought to prefer Vue or Svelte
" over React).
"
" As far as emacs goes, I briefly (and enthusiastically!) used emacs as my
" main editor, and actually got it working pretty nicely. I was an emacs user
" for a little bit before landing on vim, and it was fun going back. I *love*
" org-mode, and I really enjoyed having a nice literate config that could
" output to html, etc. I also love emacs-lisp. I love lisps! I don't love
" vimscript! BUT, I'm also wary of emulation, and I knew eventually I was
" going to run into something in evil that wasn't vimmy enough for my tastes,
" or maybe just a vim plugin that didn't have an evil analogue. Also I've just
" been living in vim for so long and learning the entire emacs ecosystem was
" just a lot. I've been trying to rein in my learnign ambitions and focus
" better on a smaller set of tools, and at the end of the day, that's what
" probably tipped the scales in favor of returning to vim.
"
" All that in mind, here are some goals I'm trying to keep in mind while
" rebuilding my vimrc from scratch:
"
"   1. Comment *every* line. Don't put anything in here that I don't
"   understand and can't explain in a comment.
"   2. Keep the number of plugins small but don't be a zealot about it. If I
"   don't feel like becoming a netrw master, it's ok to use NERDtree.
"   3. Keep it organized
"
" In my last go-round with vim before wandering in the editor desert for a
" bit, I tried neovim. I may again, but for now the plan is to stick with
" Vim8.
"
" Ok, that's a lot. Now, here is the stuff that makes vim into vim for me.
" Much, much more TK. I'm trying to rebuild this slowly and thoughtfully,
" rather than just pasting in configs from whatever vim article floated across
" the transom at HN that day.

" These are essential to vim just working the way you'd expect vim to work
